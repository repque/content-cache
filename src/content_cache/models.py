    Enum representing file integrity check results.

    Provides a type-safe way to represent the outcome of file integrity
    verification. Rather than using magic strings or boolean flags, this enum

    - Includes both content and blob path to support hybrid storage
    - Tracks access patterns (count, last_accessed) for LRU eviction
    - Uses Pydantic for validation and serialization consistency
    - Supports both string and Path inputs for flexibility

    - Verify content freshness (modification_time, content_hash)
    - Implement cache eviction policies (access_count, last_accessed)
    - Support storage tier decisions (content vs content_blob_path)
    - Enable analytics and monitoring (extraction_timestamp, file_size)

        content_blob_path=None, while large content is stored as compressed
        blobs with the path recorded here.
